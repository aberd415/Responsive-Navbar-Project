            <p>Well, how'd you become king, then? I have to push the pram a lot. Oh, ow! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! I have to push the pram a lot. â€¦Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Found them? <strong> In Mercia?!</strong> <em> The coconut's tropical!</em> The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.</p>
        <h2>It's only a model.</h2>
            <p>Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. Well, how'd you become king, then?</p>
                <ol>
                <li>How do you know she is a witch?</li><li>Oh, ow!</li><li>What a strange person.</li>
                </ol>

        <h3>It's only a model.</h3>
            <p>And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Well, I didn't vote for you. We found them. Now, look here, my good man. Shut up!</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Well, how'd you become king, then?</li><li>You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!</li><li>Well, we did do the nose.</li>
